# Emote

Small lib for converting emoticons and emoji names to emoji characters:

```elixir 
Emote.convert_text("my emoji game is :fire: ;-)")
# > "my emoji game is ðŸ”¥ ðŸ˜‰"
```

There's known limitations:
    
1. Emojis combined together don't work, ex.: ":woo:pile_of_poo:hoo:" would not convert.
